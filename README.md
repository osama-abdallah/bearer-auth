## My notes

we learned about tokens and the JWT library, we created a new token for the sign in and authenticated and autherised it, therefor we learned how to verify this token, we also created created the SECRET to act as the key to unlock the token we created. In this lab we had the tests already created for it and we did some debugging for it to try to get it to pass the tests but the weirdest thing was that when you run the tests indivisually they work but  when you run them all togther one always fails in the basic auth test.
